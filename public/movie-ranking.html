<h1>The Best Movies According to Yash</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Naruto</h3>
<p>Its an anime series. I loved the way the characters are written in the whole series.</p>

<h3>Attack on Titan</h3>
<p>Its also an anime series. The storytelling of this series is on the whole other level. I am a bit inspired by the qualities of two characters- Eren and Levi</p>

<h3>2012</h3>
<p>This movie shows how nature can backfire us in an unexpected way if we go on polluting our mother earth.</p>
